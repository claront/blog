About Claron Twitchell

Thanks for wanting to know a little more about me.  I first became involved with South Sudanese who were coming to the USA on refugee status in 2001.  I traveled with three of my friends to their home villages in South Sudan in 2007.  We started to help by sending money to allow a group of ten local women in Akobo, South Sudan to purchase grain which they ground by hand to feed 58 orphans in their village.

It has grown to elementary education and orphan care in the villages of South Sudan with about 1500 students in the schools we help.  We provide funds for teacher's salary and a meal each school day for the orphans.  

Sponsor me on my 1000 mile walk with a penny or more per mile by clicking the [Donate](./donate) button.

I live with my wife (except for the three months of the walk) in Salt Lake City, Utah.  We have three children who have brought us eleven grandchildren.

Professionally, I am a software developer.  My current passion is Ruby on Rails.

The best way to reach me is by email at <claront@gmail.com>.
