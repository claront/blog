{% img center /images/dustin_katie.png 640 383 'Dustin and Katie Kelm near Lebanon, Kansas' %}[Dustin and Katie Kelm](https://www.facebook.com/RefugeRide) stopped and talked to me today.  They are riding unicycles with a 56 inch wheel across the United States to raise money to help Syrian refugees.

They stay in hotels at night.  It looks like it would be tough to carry much on a unicycle.  It is sad to think of places like South Sudan and Syria and all the refugees, but it is wonderful to meet people trying to do something to help.
