Blue Mountain, Colorado appears to have about 4 families living there.  Human habitations are miles apart, usually with no services available to the traveler.  There is a stark beauty in this semi-arid land.  I walked 20 miles today from Dinosaur to Massadona.  There is a small restaurant in Massadona, and I enjoyed a meal there.  They let me camp on their property at no charge.  Thank you!
