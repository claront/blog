Beautiful Farm House
{% img center /images/farm_home.png 640 210 'Farm House, Seneca, Kansas' %}I really liked the looks of this farm house near Seneca, Kansas.  It makes me happy to see people prospering.

I took the picture in 2007 in a village near our school in Nyamlel, South Sudan.  Your donation provides an education for children and a brighter future.
