I slept at the park in Mankato, Kansas.  Steve was at the park in the morning, apparently his regular routine to drive there each morning to read his newspaper.  I guess he is about my age.  We talked about my walk and many other things.  He wondered why we should help children in far parts of the world when there are children that do not have enough to eat in this country.  He was friendly, polite and respectful to me, and was sincerely interested in exploring the why with me.  I told him that there are a lot of good causes in the world.  I am not sure that it is as important which cause you pick to support, but that you support some good cause.  I feel blessed to be able to help the orphans and other children in South Sudan.  They need and appreciate the help.
