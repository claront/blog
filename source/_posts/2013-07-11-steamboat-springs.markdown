Steamboat Springs

{% img left /images/steamboat_springs.png 320 240 'Steamboat Springs' %}When the town was being established, they said that the sound of this warm spring reminded them of the sound of a steamboat, so they named the town Steamboat Springs.  This is a picture of the real steamboat springs.  It is easy to take a walking tour when you are already walking.  I feel like a tourist walking through Steamboat Springs, Colorado.  Walked 18 miles today.
