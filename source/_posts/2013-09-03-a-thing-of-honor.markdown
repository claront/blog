They got out of their car and talked to me for a while.  I told  them that I was doing a fund raiser to help the orphans and other children in South Sudan in the schools supported by [Southern Sudan Humanitarian](http://www.sudanhelp.org).  I explained that I had been to South Sudan twice and that people could [sponsor me](http://follow.claront.com/donate/) on my walk to help the children.  Tom was impressed and kind to praise my efforts.  Without knowing the title of my website, he said, "So, what you are doing is a thing of honor."  I thought that was rather profound and a different way of applying the word "honor" to my walk.  I usually speak of me honoring the refugees, their fortitude, stamina and courage.  Knowing what I know about what they have been through, the challenges they have been through, having "put my hand to the plough" to help them, making a serious effort to help even more by doing the thousand mile walk is a matter of me maintaining my honor and integrity.
