Yampa River near Maybell, Colorado

{% img center /images/yampa_river_maybell.png 800 382 'Yampa River near Maybell, Colorado' %}

I walked 37 miles on Wednesday, going from Massadona to Maybell.  Maybell was the next town with any services, a store and a park.  Thursday I walked 20 miles.  I saw my first coyote on the trip.  Coyotes are not often spotted in my outdoor experiences.  I saw maybe 20 or more antelope.  

Friday, I only had ten miles to walk to Craig and I have stayed here for three days.  I think my legs are rested up.  The land is gradually getting greener and more fertile as I have walked east this week.
