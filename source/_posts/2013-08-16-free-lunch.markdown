I was camped between towns last night three miles west of Prairie View, Kansas.  I was next to a lightly traveled county road about 150 yards from the main highway, U.S. 36.  I was getting packed up ready to start walking for the day and heard a car come down the road and stopped next to me.  A young woman asked me if I needed a lunch.  She gave me the lunch she had made for herself to eat at her work.  How kind!  She makes a great macaroni salad!  

It has been a while since I camped outside of town, so I rather enjoyed staying out in the countryside.  I enjoyed seeing the fireflies.  I was surprised to hear the howling of coyotes coming from several different directions.  I rather enjoyed listening to them.  I did not realize they had a significant coyote population in Kansas.  It has also been fun to see whitetail deer on a regular basis.  In Utah, we have mule deer and not whitetail.

I thought it was a good illustration of the prairie topsoil and the underlying earth.  I estimate the topsoil is 2 to 3 feet deep.  Please make a comment if you know if the underlying earth here is what is called "hardpan."
