Claron Celebrating Half-way

{% img left /images/claron_half_way.png 320 260 'Claron Half-way' 'Claron Half-way eight miles east of Brush, Colorado' %}Hoooaaa!!!  I am half-way from Salt Lake City, Utah to Independence, Missouri (Kansas City).  I knew that I was getting close, so I used the "Walk" button on Google Maps and it came out that half-way is eight miles east of Brush, Colorado.  I added the miles to the first mile maker that I saw and the magic mile marker is "180."  I feel blessed to have made it this far, 540+ miles.  I started out saying that the 1083 mile walk would take me about three months.  Achieving half-way on Thursday, August 1, 2013, is six-and-on-half weeks of the thirteen weeks in three months, since I started on Monday, June 17, 2013.  Shortly after I took the picture of the half-way celebration, I got a good dose of rain and made it to Akron, Colorado about 10:30PM.  About 24 miles for Thursday.

Pavilion at Washington County Fairgrounds

I slept under the pavilion at the fairgrounds.  I found out that the fair keeps going until midnight and the roosters start crowing at 4:30AM.  A short night's sleep for me.
