{% img left /images/mandy_and_brenda.png 219 320 'Mandy and Brenda in Atwood, Kansas' %}I met some nice people in Atwood, Kansas today.  Mandy and Brenda talked to me in the park were I camped.  They were very interested in me and my walk to raise funds for the orphans in South Sudan.  I attended the Methodist Church in Atwood and had a bunch of people donate.

I like to think of you, my reader, as the hope of South Sudan.  Yes, there are a lot of good causes to help, but helping the orphans and other children in the elementary schools which [Southern Sudan Humanitarian](http://www.sudanhelp.org/) supports is a great cause to join.  [Donate and make a difference!](http://follow.claront.com/donate/)  The children in the photo were dropped off from an internally displaced persons camp with not much more than the ragged shirts on their backs.  The video, [The Hope of Sudan](http://youtu.be/ucizvfajaf8) was taken with the children in the above picture in Gong Machar, South Sudan.
