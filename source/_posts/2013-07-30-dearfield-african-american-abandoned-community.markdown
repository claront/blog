Deserted Buildings at Dearfield, Colorado

{% img center /images/dearfield_buildings.png 640 210 'Dearfield, Colorado' 'Dearfield, Colorado' %}I camped a few hundred feet from these abandoned buildings.  This is the first time I have ever seen the road sign entering a town "Dearfield" and the road sign leaving a town only about one hundred feet apart.

Monument Telling the Dearfield Story

{% img center /images/dearfield_monument.png 640 480 'Dearfield, Colorado' 'Dearfield, Colorado' %}This monument tells the story of an effort to make a home for African-Americans in 1910.  Racial segregation would have been general across the United States at the time.  This was only 45 years from the end of the Civil War.  Blacks were slaves and then when they were emancipated, they were homeless.  

It gave me additional pause to think about how do we treat each other as individuals, communities, nations and internationally, so that there are no refugees, slaves or homeless.  I hope to share some some thoughts on the solution in another post.
