Sports Complex, Kansas City, Missouri as the sun sets

It is strange sleeping in a real bed and not looking for a new place to camp each night.  I got a room for four nights at the "Four Points By Sheraton Kansas City - Sports Complex" while I am waiting for my flight home to Salt Lake City.  I am resting up and catching up on my blog posts.  The picture of the scene at sunset is of the Kansas City Royals stadium and next to it on the left is the Kansas City Chiefs stadium.  The picture is taken from my hotel room on the fifth floor.  When you are walking long distances, it is a little bit hard to predict exact dates of when you are going to be someplace.  I booked my return flight out far enough to get a good price, and then I picked up the pace and got to Independence a day early.

They are the directors at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Visitors Center in Independence.
