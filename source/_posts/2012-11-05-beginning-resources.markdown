During this meeting we were able to push up the first [four resources](https://github.com/rubycommcollege/campus/commit/2988334dbf8f35d0cc26b596c9ccd5988ac2799b) to github which include the following:

* Courses
* Assignments
* Study Plans
* Users

We did so by using the Rails scaffold generator and discussed the pros and cons of this method.  The pros being that it's a quick way to get to the common RESTful pattern for any given resource.  And the con being that since it only represents the least common denominator of the RESTful pattern, we'll need to build from there in order to make the app do what we need it to do.
