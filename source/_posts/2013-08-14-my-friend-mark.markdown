Mark is a fellow board member of [Southern Sudan Humanitarian](http://www.sudanhelp.org) and a great friend of mine. We traveled to South Sudan together in 2011 and he went again in 2012.  He was helping his son move from Utah to go to school in Arkansas.  Mark made a special effort to meet up with me along the way.  He brought me some new bicycle tires, tubes, and protein powder.  A short visit, but it meant a lot to me.  Please comment on this post by clicking on the title at the top of the article [My Friend Mark](http://follow.claront.com/blog/2013/08/14/my-friend-mark/).
