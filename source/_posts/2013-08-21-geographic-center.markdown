{% img left /images/geographic_center.png 320 240 'Sign about Geographic Center of 48 states near Lebanon, Kansas' %}I was at the geographic center of the 48 states today.  Well, since I was walking, four miles away from the exact spot was close enough.  I stayed Tuesday night in Smith Center, Kansas.  I met Dennis out riding his bike for exercise and we got to talking about my walk.  He invited me over to stay at his house for the night.  I had a shower, a real bed, home grown tomatoes in tomato sandwiches and a donation for the orphans.  Thanks Dennis!  In the first mile walking out of Smith Center town on Wednesday morning, I figure that I passed the 3/4 point of my 1083 mile walk.  Yea!!!
