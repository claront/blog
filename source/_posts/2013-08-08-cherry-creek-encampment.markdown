Marker commemorating Cherry Creek Encampment

{% img center /images/cherry_creek_encampment2.png 640 227 'Cherry Creek Encampment' 'Marker commemorating Cherry Creek Encampment near St. Francis, Kansas%}Some of the Native-American survivors of the [Sand Creek Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Creek_massacre) wintered at this site about four miles north of St. Francis, Kansas on highway 27.  A blog that honors refugees needs a post to pause and consider the incident.  On this walk, I have thought a lot about what happened to the Native-Americans.  May God bless us all to realize that the rights, privileges and lives of all people are important to them and important to us.  

There were a lot of markers commemorating the history of Cheyenne County, Kansas that were installed, I imagine as a labor of love, by Tobe Zweygart.  The curator of the museum in St. Francis showed me his picture.  He is now 97 years old.
