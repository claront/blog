Colorado Christian Cowboys from Colorado Springs, Colorado singing cowboy music.

{% img center /images/colorado_christian_cowboys.png 640 392 'Colorado Christian Cowboys' 'Colorado Christian Cowboys from Colorado Springs, Colorado singing cowboy music' %}  I attended services at the [Yuma Branch](http://www.lds.org/rcmaps/?lang=eng#ll=40.076495,-102.767315&z=12&m=google.road&layers=meetinghouse&id=meetinghouse:5002099-01-01&q=Yuma,%20co&x=find&find={c:"Yuma",p:"80759",s:"Colorado",n:"United%20States",ll:"40.122208,-102.72521"}) of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](http://mormon.org). The people were friendly at Church.  They were interested in my walk and raising money for the orphans in [South Sudan](http://www.sudanhelp.org).  One of the lay-leaders, Rockey, had me stay at his home Saturday and Sunday night.  Rockey invited me to go with him to the Sunday concert that was sponsored by the Yuma, Colorado ministerial association (maybe not the exact name).  It seems like everyone in the stands at the fairgrounds where the concert was held knew Rockey.  

I enjoyed the scenes of the fairgrounds being readied for the county fair this week.
