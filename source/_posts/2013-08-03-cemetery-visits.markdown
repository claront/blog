Cary Armstead Doggett headstone

{% img center /images/cemetery_visit.png 640 429 'Cemetery near Yuma, Colorado' %}I sometimes stop and look through cemeteries.  This one was several miles to the west of Yuma, Colorado.  Not very many headstones, and there did not seem to be a town close by.  The headstone for Cary Armstead Doggett was recent compared to his death date of June 22, 1887.  That is impressive that people, probably his descendants, are still thinking of him.  A cemetery is a place to learn, feel and think.  What have I done in my life, where am I going when I leave this life, and what will I leave behind.  You can learn a lot about the local town from the cemetery by looking for the earliest death dates in the cemetery.
