They were interested in my walk, let me take their pictures and donated.  Nice people!  When I got to Belleville, I had people in the grocery store tell me that they had seen me walking and listened to my story.  Sunday, I attended the United Methodist Church in Belleville, Kansas.  I enjoyed the services.  People were really nice to me and they donated to help the orphans and other children in the villages of South Sudan in our schools.  Some of the congregation members exchanged contact information with me.  Wouldn't that be great if we became life-long friends.
