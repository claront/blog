You can hear about our elementary education and orphan care in the villages of South Sudan by [clicking here](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/liahonatimes/2013/08/17/followclarontcom--1000-mile-walk-4-refugees).  I was interviewed on the blogtalkradio.com channel [Liahona TiMES Compass](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/liahonatimes).

{% img left /images/vince_mark.png 258 320 'Vince and Mark in Phillipsburg, Kansas' %}The bishop for the Phillipsburg, Kansas Ward of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](http://www.lds.org/?lang=eng) introduced me to Vince and Vince invited me to stay with him for the weekend.  Vince put me on blogtalkradio.com.  Vince (on the left) and his friend Mark are in the photo.  It was a blessing to have a secure place to stay for three nights.  My feet and legs were sore and tired by Friday.  I appreciate the kindnesses.
