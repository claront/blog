Rocky Mountains

{% img center /images/rocky_mountains2.png 640 345 'Rocky Mountains' 'Rocky Mountains near Cameron Pass in Colorado' %}I really feel more like a tourist than a homeless person.  I am walking through spectacular mountain scenery in Colorado.  The picture is actually taken from Tuesday, but I wanted to show why they call these the Rocky Mountains.  Today, Monday, I walked 24 miles from Walden, Colorado to Aspen Campground which is about one mile off Colorado Highway 14.
