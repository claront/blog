The June 17 start date was because I was in charge of the family reunion which had the date set of June 15.  I had a lot of help.  My grandparents, married in 1917, have about 500 descendents now.  We had more than 125 attend the reunion.  I am packed and ready to go tomorrow.  My wife and I spent 5 hours today, as we normally do on Sunday, helping the African refugees in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.  The people who came to the United States have challenges, but are grateful for the opportunities here.  Back home in Africa, the challenges are big, but of a simpler sort, like finding clean water, food to eat, not dying in child birth and getting a primary school education.
