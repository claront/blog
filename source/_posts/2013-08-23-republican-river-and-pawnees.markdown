Country of the Pawnees
{% img center /images/republican_river.png 640 480 'Republican River near Scandia, Kansas' %}The photo is of the Republican River near Scandia, Kansas.  This area was the home of the Pawnees (native Americans) for hundreds of years.  Today, the Pawnee tribal lands are in Oklahoma.  Again, a blog honoring African refugees also honors displaced native Americans.  

Walking through this country is stunning to see the vastness of it.  The farmland goes on as far as the eye can see in all directions.  The annual rainfall increases as I walk east.
