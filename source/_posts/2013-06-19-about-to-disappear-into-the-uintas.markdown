I started my walk Monday morning, June 17.  I started the walk at the "This Is the Place Monument" on the east edge of Salt Lake City, Utah.  The site commemorates the July 24, 1847 entry of Brigham Young with the first company of Mormon Pioneers into the valley of the Great Salt Lake.

I walked 15 miles the first day, 20 miles the second day and 16 miles today.  I have had the opportunity to talk to about seven people about my walk and explain how it is a fund raising effort to benefit [Southern Sudan Humanitarian](http://www.sudanhelp.org) to help the children in our schools in the villages of South Sudan.  I wrote down the uri for this blog for them.

People have been very nice to me.  Well, mostly, I am by myself except for the cars wizzing by.  But, when I do have the opportunity to talk to people, they are very nice.  Of course, I am appreciative that no one has ran over me yet.

I am camping tonight near the thriving metropolis of Woodland, Utah.  One of the locals told me that cell phone coverage stops about one mile down the road as I go into the Uinta Mountains on Utah State Road 35 to Wolf Creek Pass.  I expect that I will be out of cell coverage for about three days.
