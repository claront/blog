Rabbit Ears Pass

{% img center /images/rabbit_ears_pass.png 640 216 'Rabbit Ears Pass' %}I went over Rabbit Ears Pass named after the prominence in this photo.  A few miles south of Steamboat Springs, U.S. 40 climbs steadily with a 5-6% grade.  It was a bit of work pushing my cart and myself up 3000 feet of vertical.  It was a big deal for me, because it put me over the Continental Divide.  It is all downhill from here to Missouri.  Well, almost.  One 9,400 foot pass down and a 10,300 foot pass ahead.  

Jackson County

I made the 59 miles from Steamboat Springs to Walden, Colorado in 3 days with mileage of about 12, 24 and 23 miles.  Remember, that 3000 foot vertical was in the first day.  Walden, Colorado has a population 870 and an elevation of 8,100 feet.  I am resting on Sunday, so I went to a non-denominational community church in Walden.  Nice people!
