{% img center /images/denver_airport2.png 640 265 'Denver Airport' %}The photo is of a statue in the Denver airport.  I didn't want to ride the shuttle to Fort Collins and get off the bus not knowing where I was going just before dark, so I stayed at the airport overnight.  I met some nice people.  

I met Lianbo, who is in the USA as a visiting professor from China.  It was interesting to hear about her observations of the differences between the USA and China.  A lot of the differences come from the fact that the Chinese government has actively taught that there is no God for 70 years.  I stayed up most of the night catching up on my blog.
