Green River in Utah

This spot is near the entrance to Dinosaur National Monument.  The mountain beyond the river shows light colored rock that is distinctive for the monument.  If I recall correctly from a previous visit to the Monument, the dinosaur bone dig is near that mountain of light colored rock.

I walked 33 miles from Vernal, Utah to Dinosaur, Colorado.  My jogger stroller cart with all my equipment allows me to keep a good pace, but it is restrictive for finding camping spots.  My walk has some similarities to backpacking, but if I was backpacking in mountain wilderness as I normally do, then I would look around for a camping spot that looks good and set up where I want.  The jogger restricts me to finding a camping spot that is within a few feet of a paved road or sidewalk.

Park in Dinosaur, Colorado

{% img center /images/20130701-dinosaur-colorado.1.jpg 643 482 ‘Park in Dinosaur, Colorado’ ‘Small park on the main highwayin Dinosaur, Colorado’ %}Dinosaur, Colorado, population 339, is in a dry area, even for the Western United States.  I threw out my spleeping bag next to the swings in a little park.  The woman at the convenience store said it was okay and told me that there was a shower in the restroom that I could use.
