Green River in Utah

This spot is near the entrance to Dinosaur National Monument.  The mountain beyond the river shows light colored rock that is distinctive for the monument.  If I recall correctly from a previous visit to the Monument, the dinosaur bone dig is near that mountain of light colored rock.

Claron Twitchell at the border of Colorado and Utah on highway U.S. 40.  I walked 33 miles from Vernal, Utah to Dinosaur, Colorado.  My jogger stroller cart with all my equipment allows me to keep a good pace, but it is restrictive for finding camping spots.  My walk has some similarities to backpacking, but if I was backpacking in mountain wilderness as I normally do, then I would look around for a camping spot that looks good and set up where I want.  The jogger restricts me to finding a camping spot that is within a few feet of a paved road or sidewalk.
