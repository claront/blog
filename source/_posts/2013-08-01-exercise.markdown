Claron on Playground Equipment

I walked 25 miles Monday, 31 miles Tuesday, 13 miles Wednesday and expect to walk 24 miles today.  That burns a lot of calories and works a lot of muscles, especially in the legs, but what about the rest of my body.

I have a routine to keep my upper body and other parts fit as well.  In the morning, I do 3 sets with 15 reps of 3 different types of squats.  I do 2 sets of 15 reps with each arm of curls lifting my 25 pound bag, and then I lift the bag from my chin to over my head 2 sets of 15 reps.  I do a set of pushups, 30 to 45 reps.  If I am at a park, I do a few chin-ups and pull-ups on the playground equipment.  In the evenings, I do the squats with just one set of each of the 3.  I have some other stretching that I do during the day.  

I found out how important this routine was to me when I missed about three days just after I left Steamboat Springs.  I had a lot of rain and chose to dive into the tent at night or quick pack up and get on the road in the mornings.  On Sunday, in Walden, Colorado, my right knee was really hurting me.  I wanted to avoid squats, because it hurt.  I was blessed to have the thought come in my mind that I needed to do what hurts, because not doing the squats had brought on the sore knee.  In a couple of days of going back to my exercise routine, the sore knee went away.  Since then, I have also added five squats at every milepost.
