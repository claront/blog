I was at a loss for a response.  Being in the best condition of my life was not really an objective for me for this walk.  I would say that I feel like I am in fairly good shape.  I was in fairly good shape getting ready for this walk.  See my [Exercise](http://follow.claront.com/blog/2013/08/01/exercise/) post for more details.  I have lost maybe 5 or so pounds on the walk.  It has been a while since I have had a scales to check my weight.  Being in top physical condition requires plenty of sleep which I am not getting.  Go sleep a night in your local park and see how restful that is!  Good nutrition is also critical to be in top shape.  I am trying my best to get some nutrition down me, but that is also a challenge.  I feel very blessed that I have not been sick on this walk.  But, overall, I guess I am in fairly good shape.  Come walk 20 miles with me one day and see if I am doing okay.

The photo is the park in Prairie View, Kansas where I camped one night last week.  I put my sleeping pad and sleeping bag out on the table and slept there for the night.
