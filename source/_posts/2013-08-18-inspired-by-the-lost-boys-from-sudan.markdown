{% img center /images/brittany_family.png 640 465 'Brittany and family' 'Brittany inspired by Lost Boys from Sudan, taken at Mormon Church in Phillipsburg, Kansas%}I met a family at [church today](http://mormon.org), the mother, Brittany, said that she heard about the Lost Boys from Sudan about the time she graduated from high school.  Their story, being separated by civil war from their families, inspired her to want to be a foster mother some day.  Brittany is a foster mother and was very interested in the work of [Southern Sudan Humanitarian](http://www.sudanhelp.org/) helping the orphans and other children in the villages of South Sudan.    Please [Sponsor Claron](http://follow.claront.com/donate/) to help those children.
