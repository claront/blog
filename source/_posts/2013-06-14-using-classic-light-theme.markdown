I hope you will join me in helping the refugees that are returning to South Sudan to build a new nation and a new life for themselves.  [Donate](http://www.sudanhelp.org) to help the efforts of Southern Sudan Humanitarian to help the orphans, and other children in the villages of South Sudan.

I changed the look and colors of the blog by using the Classic Light Theme.  Running commands like ``git submodule add git://github.com/octothemes/classic-light.git .themes/light`` in the terminal.  See the [Octopress instructions](https://github.com/octothemes/classic-light#install-as-git-submodule) for more details.
