Solar Panels
{% img center /images/solar_panels2.png 640 355 'Solar Panels' 'Goal Zero Portable Solar Panels" %}The photo shows two [Goal Zero](http://www.goalzero.com/) solar panels hanging on my cart facing the sun as I was getting ready to leave my camp near Jordanelle Reservoir, Utah, the second night out on my walk.  GOALZERO sponsored me by loaning me the large solar panel in the photo and a Sherpa 50 Power Pack.  They are able to power my MacBook Air notebook computer which I use to write my blogs.  I bought the small solar panel with a backup battery and they power my smartphone.

I have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus Android smartphone which I use for all sorts of things.  It is my camera, cellphone, GPS, and mobile WiFi hotspot.  Verizionwireless is my wireless provider.  If I have a good 4G signal, I can be out in the sagebrush using my MacBook writing blog posts.  However, I also take advantage of businesses that offer WiFi, air-conditioning, wall plugs for power and a table and chair as a spot to write my blogs.  Sometimes, parks have live power outlets.  I have a couple of backup batteries for my phone as well.

I also do [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) web development when I set up camp as I get the time.  My programming buddy, [Tyler Bird](https://github.com/7hunderbird?source=cc) has been a great help showing me how to use [Octopress](http://octopress.org) as "A blogging framework for hackers."  Which means my blog is an Octopress blog as opposed to something like WordPress. (WordPress is good too.)
