A lot of beautiful scenery and great people.  I crossed the entire length of the state.  Lots of rain today.  I met Casey and his wife at church Sunday and they invited me to stay at their home in Wray.  I really appreciated it and took advantage of an extra day in a comfortable place to catch up on my email, blogging and other Internet stuff.  It was only 66 degrees when I left Wray at 2 PM, a very pleasant temperature for the first week of August.
