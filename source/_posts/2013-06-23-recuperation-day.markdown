Today was a rest day.  Like my trainer at the gym taught me, rest days are important to getting stronger.  I camped at the only park in Tabiona, Utah last night and got a good night's rest.  A guy that was out walking for his exercise around the park stopped to talk to me.  He gave me a $20 cash [donation](http://www.sudanhelp.org) for the children in South Sudan.  It was about 39 degrees Fahrenheit for a low last night, but my sleeping bag kept me warm.

I went to the local [Mormon](http://mormon.org) ward for their worship services.  My spirits were lifted at the worship services.  The people were friendly.  A wonderful family asked me to come to their home.  They fed me lunch and dinner and a bed for the night.
