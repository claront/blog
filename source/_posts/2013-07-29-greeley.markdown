I am on the plains now.  The mountains are behind me.  A lot of nice people in Greeley.  I got a haircut in Greeley and when I went to pay, the stylist said that the lady she was doing before me paid for my haircut.  What a sweet lady.  Sometimes looking like a homeless person has its benefits.  I spent a couple of extra days in Greeley catching up on my blog and resting my feet.
