Poudre River and Poudre Canyon

{% img center /images/poudre_fishing.png 640 480 'Poudre River for fishing' %}The Poudre River presents a lot of opportunities for recreation.  This picture shows a stretch of the river that looks like great trout fishing.  "Poudre" is pronounced by the locals as "pood-er" as in "food."  In Utah, we have some great canyons and streams, but this canyon goes on for ever and the river is within hearing distance from the road for, I guess over 50 miles.  It seems to go on for ever, especially when you are walking.  An amazing canyon and river.
